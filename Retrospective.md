## Experience

This project contained a lot of personal and creative freedom which was great to try out some things that have not been done in the previous labs. However this leads to a lot of time spent struggling and problem soving. One of the biggest struggles with this project was with CSS styling such as centering the correct content. 
Another large struggle was making sure that the functionality of typescript was working properly. The feature was to create a toggle dark mode/light mode feature in the program. Most of this struggle was making sure things were working properly from no previous knowledge of typescript. 

Nothing seemed to be unclear except for how much information should have been provided in the webpage. Since the idea was to make a knockoff on the selected typescript page provided, it was safe to assume that much infomation was the minimum to provide.

The entire project is completed.

## Known issues or Bugs

There are a number of errors provided in the typescript files. However these errors are not breaking the code and everything is working properly.

## Sources used

a lot of resources were used for this project. Most sources were for clarifying small css formatting.
