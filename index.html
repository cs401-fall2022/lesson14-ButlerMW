      Yesterday, All those backusdfsdfps seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. 
      Oh I believe in yesterday.

      Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone 
      hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was 
      I could not say.
    </div>
    <div id="orange-section">
      Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.
    </div>
    <div id="orange-red-section">
      Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to 
      stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
